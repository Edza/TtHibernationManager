# TtHibernationManager

Run it to hibernate safely (while preserving Tt Riing control working). After hibernate it will resume Tt Riing and exit.

Create a shortcut and pin to start menu named "Hibernate now".

I have it assigned as a keyboard macro on a macro key.

Searching for an .exe? Download Visual Studio 2015 and compile. If you want the .exe then message me and I'll guide you through the compilation process.
